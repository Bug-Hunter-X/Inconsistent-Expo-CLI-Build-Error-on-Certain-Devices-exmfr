While working with Expo CLI, I encountered a peculiar error during the build process. The error message was vague and didn't pinpoint the exact cause.  I tried various troubleshooting steps, like cleaning the cache and reinstalling dependencies, but nothing seemed to work. The error consistently appeared only on certain devices, making debugging even more challenging. The app would build and run successfully on some devices, but others would display the error message.
