# Inconsistent Expo CLI Build Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon build error encountered while using Expo CLI. The error is inconsistent, occurring only on specific devices during the build process. The error message is not very helpful in pinpointing the root cause.

## Problem Description

The app builds and runs successfully on some devices but fails on others with a vague error message.  Standard troubleshooting steps such as cache clearing and dependency reinstallation have not resolved the issue.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Attempt to build and run the app on different devices.

## Solution

The solution involves [describe the solution, e.g., identifying and resolving a specific incompatibility between a library and a particular device's architecture or OS version].  The `expoBugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code.
